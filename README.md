# JavaArrays

 
App 08 
Programming Arrays 
 
App 08 is “task oriented”.  It tells you exactly what your program should produce. 
App 08 will practice the same skills as part of a problem/solution scenario.

Loops and arrays are a natural combination.  It is always a conundrum when deciding whether to teach loops before arrays or arrays before loops.  There is no best answer.  Arrays allow for much greater use of loops and loops are more useful when used with arrays. 
  
The purpose of this App is for you to practice writing the syntax that creates and manipulates arrays.  Failure to use proper encapsulation, loops, and arrays will lower your grade significantly. 
 
Create a java program in eclipse that fulfills each of the seven requirements below.  Each requirement should be implemented in a separate method.  Each of the methods should display information telling me what I am looking out with each display. 
 
Requirements: 
1	Create a method that contains an array of integers with five elements.   
A	The user should input the array elements.   
B	After the array is fully populated, display the elements of the array. 
 
2	Create a method that contains an array of doubles with seven elements.   
A	The user should input the array elements.   
B	After the array is fully populated, displays one half of the value of each element in the array. 
C	After the one-half values are displayed, display the elements of the array. 
 
3	Create a method that contains an array of Strings with 100 elements.   
A	Initialize each element of the array to null.   
B	The user should then input Strings into the array until it encounters a trailer.  Inputs will be complete when the trailer is encountered or 100 inputs have been submitted.   C After the array is as populated, display all of the array elements that are not null. 
 
4	Create a method that contains an array of integers that contains the elements of the “times” table for the integer 7.  It should include all the values from 7*0 through 7*10.  
A	Display only the even values in your array.   
B	Display only the odd values in your array.

5	Create a method that accepts numbers into an array (The maximum size of this array should be 10 elements). 
A	The user should populate the array. 
B	Display the elements in the reverse order they were input. 
C	Display the elements in the order they were input. 
D	Display only those array elements that contain even values in the inverse order they were input.  Hint: use modulus. 
E	Display only those array elements that contain odd values in the order they were input.  Hint: use modulus. 
 
6	Create a method that accepts names until it finds a trailer (The maximum size of this array should be 10 elements).    
A	Make the trailer String in your data statement “–99”. B Display the elements in your array.
